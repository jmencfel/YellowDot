Find and open the attached Unity project of a simple Space Invaders clone called "Laser Defender".

Your task is to finish the game by implementing an enemy waves spawning mechanism and tools for game designers to configure enemy waves.

Keep the following in mind:
- you can freely modify any code, but try to keep most of your new code within the '_YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE' folder
- enemy prefabs are ready within the 'Entities/Enemies' folder, simply spawning them in the scene will be ok for this task
- your waves manager should spawn the next wave when the previous wave is fully destroyed by the player
- the designers will work within the Unity Editor to design new enemy types and waves
- the designers need a way to set the number of enemies of each type and their formation on screen in each eave
- the game might need hundreds of waves and the game designers might need to change the order of the waves or delete a wave at any time, keep that in mind when designing the tools
- please design the first few waves using your system so it's easier to grasp

Don't worry if you don't know all the specifications - make them up as you see fit.

Please send your ready project to jmysior@yellow-dot.eu
You can use an online file transfer system of your choice (GitHub, WeTransfer, GoogleDrive, OneDrive, etc.).
